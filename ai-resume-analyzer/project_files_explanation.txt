 
AI Resume Analyzer — Project file explanations
=============================================

This document explains the main folders and files in the project and gives short descriptions of every UI component in `app/components`. It also includes a brief "contract" (inputs / outputs / responsibilities) for the main UI pieces so developers can quickly understand how they fit together.

General project files (root)
----------------------------
- `package.json` — npm metadata and scripts (dev, build, preview). Lists project dependencies.
- `Dockerfile` — container image definition for deployment.
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript compiler settings.
- `vite.config.ts` — Vite build tooling configuration.
- `react-router.config.ts` — (project-specific) React Router configuration used by route setup.
- `README.md` — human-facing project overview and setup instructions.

App folder (`app/`)
-------------------
Contains the app source: routes, components and small helper libs.

- `root.tsx` — application root. Mounts the React tree, sets up global providers (Puter), error boundaries and the base HTML layout.
- `routes.ts` — route definitions used by React Router; wires pages and data loaders to paths.
- `app.css` — global styling rules and design tokens used across components.

app/components — explanation and small contracts
------------------------------------------------
Below are the components found in `app/components`. For each component I list the purpose, typical props/inputs, outputs/side-effects, and notes about edge-cases or integration points.

1) `Accordion.tsx`
	- Purpose: Generic collapsible panel component used to show/hide content sections.
	- Inputs/props: title/label (string), defaultOpen? (boolean), children (ReactNode)
	- Outputs/side-effects: none (pure UI). May call a callback when toggled if such prop exists.
	- Notes/edge cases: Should support keyboard accessibility (Enter/Space to toggle). Large content should be scrollable; measure height or use CSS transitions for smoothness.

2) `ATS.tsx`
	- Purpose: Displays ATS (Applicant Tracking System) related results: score, highlights, and suggestions for improving resume ATS compatibility.
	- Inputs/props: atsResult (object containing score:number, issues: string[], suggestions: string[]), concise? (boolean)
	- Outputs: Renders badges, lists, and optionally emits analytics events when user expands details.
	- Notes: Keep long suggestion lists truncated with an expand option. Ensure numeric score is validated (0–100).

3) `Details.tsx`
	- Purpose: Show detailed information about a particular resume or job matching result. Used on resume view pages.
	- Inputs/props: resume (object with fields like name, email, sections[]), onEdit? (callback), onDelete? (callback)
	- Outputs: Renders full resume metadata and parsed sections. Calls callbacks only when user triggers actions.
	- Notes: Must handle missing fields gracefully (e.g., no email). When rendering parsed HTML/text, sanitize or treat as plain text to avoid injection.

4) `FileUploader.tsx`
	- Purpose: UI for uploading resumes (drag-and-drop or file dialog). Accepts PDFs and common doc formats.
	- Inputs/props: accept (mime types), onFilesSelected(files: File[]), multiple? (boolean)
	- Outputs/side-effects: Reads the dropped file(s), optionally creates previews (images), and calls `onFilesSelected` with File objects or parsed data.
	- Notes/edge cases: Provide clear validation messages for unsupported file types, large files, or failed reads. Use PDF worker (public/pdf.worker.min.mjs) for parsing PDFs without blocking UI.

5) `Navbar.tsx`
	- Purpose: Top navigation bar with links to Home, Upload, Sign in/out, and other pages.
	- Inputs/props: currentUser? (object), onSignOut? (callback)
	- Outputs: Emits navigation actions, calls auth callbacks.
	- Notes: Mobile responsive; collapse to hamburger menu on small widths.

6) `ResumeCard.tsx`
	- Purpose: Small card preview for a resume used in lists or galleries.
	- Inputs/props: resumeSummary (title, subText, thumbnailUrl), onOpen/resumeId
	- Outputs: Click opens the resume details or navigates to resume page.
	- Notes: Prefetch detailed resume data on hover/click for snappier UX.

7) `ScoreBadge.tsx`
	- Purpose: Small colored badge indicating a score level (good/warning/bad).
	- Inputs/props: score (number) or level ('good'|'warn'|'bad'), size?
	- Outputs: Purely visual.
	- Notes: Map numeric ranges to discrete levels consistently across the app.

8) `ScoreCircle.tsx`
	- Purpose: Circular progress indicator for a numeric score.
	- Inputs/props: value (0-100), size, strokeWidth, color mapping function
	- Outputs: SVG/CSS animated circle.
	- Notes: Use aria-label for accessibility; use reduced-motion preference for animations.

9) `ScoreGauge.tsx`
	- Purpose: Gauge-style display for score (semi-circle or bar gauge).
	- Inputs/props: value (0-100), thresholds
	- Outputs: Visual gauge + numeric label.
	- Notes: Consider animating once when mounted; avoid re-animating on every prop update unless desired.

10) `Summary.tsx`
	 - Purpose: High-level summary of analysis results for a resume: top issues, overall score, and call-to-actions.
	 - Inputs/props: analysis (object with overallScore, highlights, suggestedChanges)
	 - Outputs: Rendered summary and clickable suggestions.
	 - Notes: Keep it concise by default with an option to expand into Details.

app/lib — small utilities
-------------------------
- `pdf2img.ts` — helpers to convert PDF pages into images for previews. Uses the included `pdf.worker.min.mjs` (public) to offload parsing.
- `puter.ts` — wrappers around Puter SDK (authentication, storage, AI action wrappers). Any interaction with Puter should go through this file to centralize configuration and tokens.
- `utils.ts` — general helper functions (formatting, small shared utilities used across components).

app/routes — page-level components
---------------------------------
- `auth.tsx` — authentication flow (sign-in / sign-up) using Puter; may display OAuth or email flows.
- `home.tsx` — main landing page; shows upload CTA, recent resumes, and high-level information.
- `resume.tsx` — resume viewer page that shows `ResumeCard`, `Details`, `ATS`, and `Summary` for a single resume.
- `upload.tsx` — page that presents `FileUploader` and handles upload flow + validation.
- `wipe.tsx` — utility page for clearing user data (used for testing or dev). Should be guarded behind auth.

constants/
-----------
- `index.ts` — central place for app-wide constants: acceptable file types, score thresholds, limits, and smaller config values.

public/
------
- Static assets served directly by the app (icons, images, `pdf.worker.min.mjs` used for PDF parsing in the browser).

types/
------
- `index.d.ts`, `puter.d.ts` — TypeScript ambient declarations and types for third-party libraries (like Puter) or shared app types.

Developer notes & small checklist
---------------------------------
- When adding a new component, include a small "contract" comment at top describing props and expected data shapes.
- Sanitize any parsed resume text before rendering. Treat unknown fields as optional.
- Keep UI components small and focused: pages should compose small components rather than include a lot of logic.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Expand this file to include the props/types for each component by reading the `.tsx` files and extracting prop definitions.
- Generate a markdown version (`docs/components.md`) with links to source files.

Project Dependencies Explained
---------------------------
This section explains the key dependencies used in the project and why they're necessary.

Main Dependencies:
----------------
1. React Core & DOM (`react`, `react-dom`)
   - The foundation of our UI - React is used for building the component-based interface
   - React DOM handles rendering these components to the web browser
   - Using version 19+ for latest features like concurrent rendering and suspense

2. Routing (`react-router`, `@react-router/node`, `@react-router/serve`)
   - Handles client-side navigation between pages
   - Provides server-side rendering capabilities
   - Manages URL states and page transitions
   - Node and serve packages enable server-side routing features

3. PDF Processing (`pdfjs-dist`)
   - Mozilla's PDF.js for parsing and rendering PDF resumes
   - Enables extracting text and creating preview images from uploaded PDFs
   - Runs in the browser to handle PDFs without server processing

4. File Upload (`react-dropzone`)
   - Provides drag-and-drop file upload functionality
   - Handles file validation and preview generation
   - Makes the upload experience smooth and user-friendly

5. State Management (`zustand`)
   - Lightweight state management for React
   - More straightforward than Redux for our needs
   - Manages global app state (user data, resume lists, etc.)

6. Styling Utilities:
   - `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`: Smart CSS class combination and deduplication
   - `tailwindcss`: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
   - `tw-animate-css`: Animation utilities for Tailwind

Development Dependencies:
----------------------
1. TypeScript Stack:
   - `typescript`: Static typing for better code quality
   - `@types/*`: Type definitions for React and Node.js
   - Essential for catching errors early and improving maintainability

2. Build Tools:
   - `vite`: Modern, fast bundler and development server
   - `vite-tsconfig-paths`: Path aliases support in Vite
   - `@tailwindcss/vite`: Tailwind integration for Vite

3. Development Utilities:
   - `@react-router/dev`: Development tools for React Router
   - Various TypeScript types for better development experience

The combination of these dependencies enables:
- Fast development with hot reloading (Vite)
- Type-safe code (TypeScript)
- Smooth file uploads (Dropzone)
- PDF processing (PDF.js)
- Clean, maintainable styling (Tailwind)
- Efficient state management (Zustand)
- Modern routing features (React Router)
